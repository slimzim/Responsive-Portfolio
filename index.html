            <p>Hey, I'm James.  Welcome to my website - I designed it myself!  I'm currently enrolled in a full stack coding bootcamp through Vanderbilt University with the hope of becoming a professional web developer by the end of 2020.  With the world in its current state of turmoil it's hard to predict the future, but this is a dream I'm trying my hardest to keep alive!  Quarantine is a good time to practice coding.</p>
            <p>I live in Nashville with my family.  For the last 13 years I've worked in the music business, but not the part you might think - I've been mostly a classical musician.  I played Principal Clarinet of the Nashville Symphony for twelve years, and I was also an active educator, clinician, and studio musician.  It was a fun stretch of life being a full-time musician, but I think it's the perfect time to change gears.  I'm enjoying the challenge of learning to code - it's like learning a new instrument!</p>
            <p>Thanks for visiting my site!  Feel free to check out my portfolio or send me a message.  Have a great day!</p>
